!!bug fixes
* RS232 (Devices) can now connect to comports > COM9
* GlyphInfo (String) now reports correct values after being fed with a zero-spread
* AsVideo (EX9.Texture) can now connect downstream via IOBoxes (Node)
* PatchAlias (VVVV) now evaluates its output correctly
* Intersect (3d Mesh Ray) memory leak fixed
* OSCDecoder (Network) now handles addresses with multiple slashes and no more "out of memory"-messages in bundle-mode
* HTTP (Network Get): now updates Name-Value pairs if any slice changes
* DynamicTexture (EX9.Texture Value): now only computes while Apply=1
* AsString (Color Hex) now clamps at 0, no longer resulting in bad output with negative values
* Expr (Value): fixed memory leak and improved speed

!!changed nodes
* FFT (Dshow9) added Frequency Scaling pin, see [http://vvvv.org/tiki-view_forum_thread.php?comments_parentId=12022&topics_threshold=0&topics_offset=14&topics_sort_mode=lastPost_desc&topics_find=&forumId=7|this discussion].
* FileTexture (EX9.Texture) & XFile (EX9.Geometry Load) can now load their textures / xfiles in a different thread in the background while the system is up and running.
* FileStream (DShow9) can now play Matroska files (if dshow-filters are installed)
* Split(String) now can deal with Spreads
* WordCount (String): fixed reset and added "Add Words" (apply) pin
* DX9Texture is now able to output a spread of textures. it works perfectly together with a multipass effect, which outputs more than one color from within its pixelshader
