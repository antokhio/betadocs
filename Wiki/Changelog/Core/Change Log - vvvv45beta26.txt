!!general
* more control over and comfort for numeric values and strings 
** you still can trust on the magic mechanism that helps you with entering valid values into ioboxes (subtype inference). Valid are only values that nodes connected to the output of the iobox can works with... (Think of the ((pin:Index)) (subtype: integer) of a ((node:GetSlice (Spreads))) connected to an iobox resulting in an iobox that helps you with entering integer values...)
** however from now on you additionally can modify this ''subtype'' (and therefore behavior of an input pin of e.g. a module and its upwards connected ioboxes) in the following way:
*** ((node:IOBox (String))) now let's you 
**** set the ((pin:Content Type)) (Any, SingleLine, FileName, Directory, URL, IP) reflected by a small (grey) icon,
**** a ((pin:Default)) string (for when the user resets the pin) 
**** a ((pin:File Mask)) (for when you choose "FileName" as the content type (check the help patch for an example that only let's the user choose files of a certain file type) 
**** and a ((pin:Maximum Characters)) that restricts the user to only enter some few characters.
*** ((node:IOBox (Value Advanced))) now lets you 
**** set the ((pin:BaseSubType)) (Real, Integer, Boolean) (meaningless configuration pins as a reaction get hidden)
**** specify the (visual) ((pin:Precision)) of a real number
**** enter a ((pin:Vector Size)) used for visual grouping of slices and as a default slice count when user resets via Alt-Right-Click
**** again a ((pin:Default)) value 
**** the ((pin:Units)) of measurement to get a better feel for certain values (use __s__ for seconds,__m__ for meters...). (these can easily be entered directly in the iobox when entering a value, e.g. "5 km/h")
*** ((pin:Minimum)) and ((pin:Maximum)) now also modify the subtype, that helps entering valid values in this and all upwards connected ioboxes. 
*** if the string representation of a value wouldn't fit into the iobox, a shorter is found by cutting of least significant digits.
** "Integer" added to the quick node list
** tooltips for vector & matrix subtypes also show up on ioboxes
** general improved accuracy in tooltips (scientific notation is used for very big and very small values, otherwise the shortest easiest representation is used). A ~ says that the decimal representation of the value would be longer and has been cut off.
** still ioboxes created over middle-click on any vector pin followed by a middle-click on the patch are the easiest way to configure ioboxes
*** now most subtype properties are copied into the iobox settings and typically need no further adjustment. (e.g. try this feature by fully configuring a first iobox, then middle-clicking on its in or output pin, followed by a middle-click on the patch)
*** hint: a further middle click labels the iobox (no new feature)
*** no longer sets the "ColsRowsPages" SliceCount mode, which eases the use of vector ioboxes as inlets for modules
** better defaults for vectors, filenames and paths
** __relative paths__ (to files and folders) are now converted into absolute paths relative to the patch where they were entered. they still are saved as relative paths though. this should solve bugs in modules that received file paths, since they now already receive a solid absolute path...
** ((pin:Pin Visibility)) lets you specify how an iobox shows up as a pin from outside the patch (if a ((pin:Descriptive Name)) has been entered))
* less confusing node pin tool tips
* better root
* major fixes on texture feedback and resource handling for multi monitor setups
* new quitoptions: open patch, new patch, quit
* implemented new caching mechanism via nodelist.xml; 
** if a search path (added via ((node:NodeList (VVVV)))) contains a nodelist.xml, all node infos beneath this path are read from the nodelist.xml file only.
** if a search path does not contain a nodelist.xml, the directory is scanned as usual.
** vvvv and the addonpack are shipped with their nodelist.xml files respectively.
** for power users: a nodelist.xml file can be generated for a user defined search path by calling 'vvvv.exe /nodelist SEARCH_PATH'.
** comparison of startup times incl. addonpack (after windows reboot / second time):
*** beta23 (1047 nodes): ~9s / ~3s
*** beta26 (1380 nodes): ~12s / ~3s
* ((pin:Layer)) outputs on Quads, Effects (...) only show up one slice, reflecting that you can't index into a "layer spread".
* some filter nodes now work with "seconds" (time value subtype)
* Reloading a patch now doesn't result in disconnecting from its surroundings in the parent patch any longer. You are also asked for if you would want to save your work from now on. 
* fixed some (last) enum bugs
* under some circumstances disabled nodes using transform input pins didn't fetch upstream transforms when switched to enabled state
* a color pin didn't report that its values changed if the change wasn't greater than a certain threshold. this led to various inaccuracies in some nodes.
* unfounded red nodes bug fix
* catweasels conversion bug fixed. ((forum:addons-path-incorrect-on-start-patch-before-vvvv.exe))

* crack.exe does better checks for existing components and offers more explanations
* fixed mouse freeze/crash for cases when no Mouse (System Global) is used
* freeframe and vst .dlls can be referenced locally again
* no more problems with patches not loading that store "invalid characters"
* new effects compiler that is substantially faster in special cases and no longer allows the ps_1.0 profile

* some bug fixes regarding replacement of missing (red) nodes.
* fixed an issue where a change from an output pin of type 'Node' wasn't acknowledged by downstream nodes which were evaluated some frame later.
* Interlave plugins from ((user:vux)) are in the difff.xml and convert to ((node:Vector (Spreads Join))) now.
* patches that where edited once in versions >= beta25, than again in versions < beta25 could get corrupted when opening with current vvvversions again. fixed that weirdo ((contribution:SiftNearmost (2d)))
* better error reporting can be activated via the main menu (ExceptionDialog) or enabled via command line argument '/showexceptions'.
* dynamic plugin templates reference System.Core, SlimDX and VVVV.Utils3rdParty by default now
* better error reporting if dragging a dynamic plugin on a patch (*.csproj file) fails
* dynamic plugins couldn't resolve referenced assemblies in some cases

* press ctrl+f in reference dialog of project explorer to search in global assembly cache
