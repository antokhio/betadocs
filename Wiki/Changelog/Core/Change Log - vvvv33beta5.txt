released on 29 08 03

!!general
* improved boygrouping pervvormance and rendering speed -  if boygrouping nodes need each other they are boygrouped together
* converted to directX9 due to better performance of video and gdi textures.  converted categories DX8 to DX9, Textures to Textures9 and DShow8 to DShow9
* when loading patches saved with older versions than beta5 conversion will be done according to difff.xml
* undo should work pretty well. just note that some few operations like resetting/boygrouping the node are internally split into two actions so that you have to undo twice to get your node back
* improved speed of IOBoxes. they aren't evaluated if hidden and in input mode

!!gui
*added: ShortCut to 'Rescan for Modules' (Ctrl+M)
*changed: in the autocomplete nodelist start with a '.' to get patches from the current patchs directory
*new: shortrightclick a valuepin to enter a constant
*fixed: alt+rightclick for string- and enumpins

*changed: IOBox (String) accepts dropped files
*changed: spreading a Triangle (dx9 Indexed) spreads the whole geometry
*changed: IOBox (Node) has binsize pin to group slices (only for transformations yet)
*changed: spectral nodes better (bin size instead of bin count; -1 means operate on whole spread. spreadable)
