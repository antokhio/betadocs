released on 29 02 03

!!documentation:
* added hello world tutorial
* added 3d tutorial
* added Index in Manual
* added new demo patches in girlpower folder
* added new subpatch modules in modules folder
* improved lots of changes and clarifications in manual

!!graphics:
* added: DX8Texture which allows to use renderings of a DX8Renderer as a texture (compare with GDITexture). This will allow for all sorts of feedback effects
* added: "Depth Buffer"-Pin to DX8Renderer, which allows to toggle DepthBuffering.
* added: "Invert Depth"-Pin to DX8Renderer; if enabled results in showing most hidden background particles on top of foreground

* added: "Clear Depth Buffer" which allows to toggle clearing depthbuffer independent from clear colorbuffer ("Clear")
* fixed: directx nodes should work one much more graphics cards now. (works also on a 300€ computer with onboard graphic card S3; also tested Matrox G40/G450; some GeForce)
* improved: DX8Texture allows to create alpha textures; Pin: "Alpha"
* improved: handling of rope and segment should be easier now
* improved: TSAdressMode introduces new pins for explicitly cycling textures (hard to explain) look at patch "pitch on pole" and toggle "Cycle U" in node "TSAdressMode"; "Border Color" Pin introduced for address mode "Border"
* improved: one frame flickering removed which appeared when changing resolution of grid.
* fixed & improved: Invert; now you have to connect to "Source"-Pin what you want to invert
* fixed: spreading a texture/renderstate will now spread the particle
* fixed: Perspective (Transform): Near Plane / Far Plane
ATTENTION: if you have a Renderer (DX8) with a viewport transformation - due to that modification you now have to explicitly add an orthogonal camera (Ortho (Transform)) to your viewport which lets you specify the visible Z-Range (Near Plane / Far Plane)
* added: Perspective (Transform, OffCenter), Ortho (Transform), Ortho (Transform, OffCenter) which allow to define new cameras.
added: UniformScale (Transform)

!!new nodes:
* Renderer (HTML) uses Internet Explorer to draw HTML text input
* IO (Devices, Wiesemann+Theis Digital EA) allows use of interface (see http://www.wut.de)
* Scroll (Spreads) allows Scrolling through numeric spreads
* Stallone (Color) like Stallone for Values
* Stallone (String) like Stallone for Values
* SystemFolders (File) will return all kinds of important folders in your system
* SubDir (File) will return all subdirectories in a directory
* LogFile (VVVV) allows a logfile to be created, which will log all errors.
* AsValue (String) node to convert strings to numerical values
* Boost (VVVV) will set your applications priority higher. will reduce jitter while rendering
* Power (Value) basic math node for raising x to the y´th power.
* GetPatchMode (VVVV)/SetPatchMode (VVVV) for getting/setting the appearance (dimensions and component mode) of the surrounding patch
* SetGammaRamp (Windows), GetGammaRamp (Windows) allows you to get/set the gamma ramp of your display
* TouchScreen (Devices, ELOTouch) Encapsulates a Touchscreen by ELO connected to the serial port (http://www.elotouch.com)

!!fixed nodes
* IRC (Network) removed several bugs, no more automatic user names
* BezierLoop (GDI) will calculate its control points correct
* Stallone (Spreads) sort modes now working

!!changed nodes
* Renderer (TTY) will now use Background color has new pin Foreground color
* Dir (File) is now spreadable and has option for listing also Hidden and System files.
* Expr (Value) is not case sensitive anymore
* Counter (Animation) has new pin for default value at startup or after reset
* TypoSpread values now uses correct bounding box, introduced Height Pin (this may break some patches). added mode for proportional scaling of text. fixed bug with long input texts
* additional modes in RetroColors

!!gui
* "save as" button in save options dialog
* /allowmultiple command line option that allows starting multiple instances of vvvv
* screenshots made via Ctrl F9/F10 now include the cursor
* quitOptions dialog will prompt you when closing the last window
* saveAsReloadOptions dialog will prompt you when saveAsing to a different path
* alt+rightclicking a node resets all its values
* alt+leftclick a selected node to duplicate the current selection
* when over a node with the mouse for half a second the infotip shows the exact name of the node
* autocompletenodelist now includes all patches that are in the current patchs directory
* right mousebutton changevaluefeeling is more sensible
* ctrl+leftclick in patch no longer locks the patch (use CTRL+E)
* a locked patch is indicated by a # in the caption
* resetting a pin with ALT+rightclick also resets its slicecount
* subpatchnodes now show their filename without path and extension
* save options dialog stays in front of other windows
* doubleclicking a patch in explorer doesn't close other open patches
* doubleclicking a patch in explorer doesn't open a second empty patch
* setup will now recognize DirectX 9
* locked patches open in correct dimensions
* minimizing vvvv with a click on its taskbaricon now works
* you may now use relative paths (relative to the patch they are in) for textures and subpatches
* infotip is now constrained to the monitor where the mouse is
* main menu is now constrained to monitor where the mouse is
* no more occasional ugly white handles on links and nodes
* no more occasional crashes when switching componentmodes of patches (make sure to run setup.exe and uncheck/check AddFlow-Button)
* some of Hrn.Inspektors bitchy behavior

* no more topmost tooltips if vvvv is inactive
