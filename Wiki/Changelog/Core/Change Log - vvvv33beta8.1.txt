!!general
* c++/delphi developers: ((AddOns.FreeFrame|write your own freeframe plugins)) even with opencv features!
* Alt+e now removes no longer existing externals
* legacy modules no longer show up in nodelists
* screenshot of the day will also generate a thumbnail for a faster homepage
* no more restart needed when adding/removing USB/Firewire game- and videodevices

!!new nodes
* ScreenShot (Textures9) guess what!
* LocalInfo (Windows) for now only outputs system language
* Variance (Spectral) for statistics 
* HarmonicMean (Spectral) for statistics 
* RootMeanSquare (Spectral) for statistics 
* Indices (Spectral) illustrates how spectral nodes work with their slices
* Trautner (FreeFrame DShow9) retrieves movement in specified areas of the image
* Contour (FreeFrame DShow9) reads contours out of images
* Port (Devices) access hardware ports (read/write). to use this node you must download the [http://www.geekhideout.com/iodll.shtml |"io.dll"] and place it in your /bin or system32 directory. use with caution, can do anything to your hardware, including instant blue screens, hard disc corruption etc. we used it to access the printer port.
* GameController (Devices JoyWarrior) for plug and play access to the JoyWarrior24A8-8 module
* MidiOut (DShow9) renders a midi stream to the specified device
* Mesh (Ex9.Geometry Join) creates a mesh dynamically receiving a vertexbuffer and an indexbuffer
* VertexBuffer (Ex9.Geometry Join) takes position, specular + diffuse color, texturecoordinates etc. and creates a vertexbuffer out of it; to be used in conjunction with Mesh (Ex9.Geometry Join)
* VertexBuffer (Ex9.Geometry Split) outputs the data in a vertex buffer; to be used in conjunction with GetVertexBuffer(Ex9.Geometry Mesh)
* GetVertexBuffer (Ex9.Geometry Mesh) returns the vertexbuffer of a mesh
* GetIndexBuffer (Ex9.Geometry Mesh) returns the indexbuffer of a mesh 
* CreateNode (VVVV) creates and replaces nodes by given id and parentpatch
* DeleteNode (VVVV) deletes nodes by given id and parentpatch
* Text (EX9.Geometry) creates a mesh containing 3D-Text. don't use this for dynamic text, cause it's quite expensive''

!!changed nodes
* FreeFramePlugins can be disabled (alternative to non possible switching)
* FileStream (DShow9) now plays Quicktime and RealMedia files if you have installed [http://home.hccnet.nl/h.edskes/mirror.htm|quicktime & real alternative]
* FileStream (DShow9) got additional Midi Output
* Window (Windows) reactivated Alpha Pin 
* Self (VVVV) addidtionally outputs patch caption
* HWND, SendMessage, ShowWindow, Window now all work with numeric window handles
* AVIParser (File) fixed posterframe-time bug
* GeometricMean (Spectral) bugs fixed
* bugs concerning all Spectral Nodes fixed (play with Indices (Spectral); try to use several bins..)
* Pipet (EX9.Texture) now reports correct alpha
* MidiShortOutput (Devices): fixed bug with multiple instances
* Length (String), Change (String), Change (Value): got a fix with empty sets
