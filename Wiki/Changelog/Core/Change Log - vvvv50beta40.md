# Change Log - vvvv50beta40
released on 07 07 20  

* Updated VL to version 2020.1.6  
* Update to latest RCPSharp  
* Fixes for Spout thanks to a <a href="https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk/pull/293" class="extURL" target="_blank">PR by @leadedge</a>  
* Fixed regression introduced in beta39 crashing vvvv when putting a DX11 renderer into boxed mode. This bug was also present in earlier versions but only harder to reproduce, one had to create a Keyboard (Window) node BEFORE creating the renderer.  
* Fixed an issue with filedialogs opening on pin rightlick
