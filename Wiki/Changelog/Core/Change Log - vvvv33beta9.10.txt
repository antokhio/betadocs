released on 23 12 05
!!general
* MAJOR improvements in multimonitor support & fullscreen management. WARNING: in the past renderer windows popped up while loading patches. now that's pretty cleaned up now. however some renderers in your project might by invisible now. right-click them or select and press "Alt-1" to get them windowed.
* HelpPatches have been relocated: only HelpPatches of nativvvve nodes are in the \help directory. HelpPatches for modules\freeframes\effects now lie just next to (in the same directory) their respective .v4p\.dll\.fx files. no more \help\modules, \help\effects ...also works for your modules\subfolders!
