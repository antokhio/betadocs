* in case a plugin node crashes during node creation the corresponding node in the patch will stay red
* dynamic plugins will always include the debug symbols now - easier to attach visual studio that way
* fix for slow panning patch ((forum:new-bugs-in-beta-33.3))
* Setup.exe 
** now also checking for MSVC++ 2012 (needed only for Assimp nodes in addonpack)

* fixed performance issue for various value nodes in x64 builds
* updated Sanford.Midi.dll which works now correctly in x64 builds

* fixed slow window-docking
* change detection rework for integer and boolean pins. fixes ((forum:iobox-ui-bug-with-grid-node))

* fix on plugininterface. bug surfaced when writing into input pins. fixes ((forum:dedicated-to-timeliner-node))
* boygrouping: some warning message got more meaningful
