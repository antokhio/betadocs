The NodeBrowser is the central access point to all nodes that exist within vvvv. This is from where you create the nodes with which you build your patches.   

**How to open:**  
* **Double Left Click** inside an empty area in a patch  
* **Double Left Click** an existing node to replace it (and keep valid connections)  
* **Ctrl+N** to open it in a separate window  

By typing into the text field at the top you can filter the list to find what you want. Then:  

* **Leftclick** a node to create it.  
* **Rightlick** a node to show its helppatch  
* **Middleclick** a node it to open its online reference page..  
* **Ctrl+Leftclick** a 'Template' node to clone it and write your own [Dynamic Plugin](TODO INTERNALLINK:dynamic-plugins) or an Effect.  

The NodeBrowser has three buttons (**T**, **C**, **F**) in top right corner:  

### T
Search the nodes by their Tags.  
Just start typing one or more words and the list will be filtered to match your search tags.   

Or type:  

* **'m '** (M followed by Space) to filter modules  
* **'v '** to filter vl plugins  
* **'d '** to filter dynamic c# plugins  
* **'p '** to filter binary .net plugins  
* **'t '** to filter patches  
* **'f '** to filter FreeFrame plugins  
* **'x '** to filter effect nodes  
* **'i '** to filter nodes with an internal version  

### C
Categorized tree view of the node list.  

### F
Filter which categories are visible in the NodeBrowser. By default all categories are on.  

These three modes can also be switched by a **Rightclick** in the text field.
