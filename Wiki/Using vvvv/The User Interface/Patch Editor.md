When vvvv starts all you see is a virgin gray window, a so called patch. Welcome to vvvv.  

**How to open:**  
* **Ctrl+P** to create a new patch  
* **Ctrl+Shift+P** to create a new subpatch  

**Symbols in the title bar**  
* \* the patch has changes  
* \~ the patch has only layout changes  
* \+ the patch is readonly  
* \# the patch is [locked](TODO INTERNALLINK:patching-basics#locking-a-patch)  
* Â° the patch is always the topmost window (toggle via CTRL+T)
