# Main Menu


![](~/img/vvvv_MainMenu.png "")  



vvvv's main menu is not visible by default in order to save precious screen-estate. Also we save you from doing a lot of mouse-meters moving the cursor to and from the menu as it is always at your finger tip and can easily invoked:  

**How to open:**  
* **Middle mouse button click** in an empty area in a patch  
* **SPACE key + Rightclick** in an empty area in a patch  

If you have a middle button, but it doesnâ€™t invoke the menu, then your system may have assigned the middle mouse button to a different function. Go to Settings > Control Panel > Mouse and look for the "middle button assignment" to fix that.
