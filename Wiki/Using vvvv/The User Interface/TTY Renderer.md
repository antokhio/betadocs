# TTY Renderer

![](~/img/vvvv_TTYRenderer.png "")   



The <span class="node">Renderer (TTY)</span> has 3 main purposes:  
* mostly it is used as vvvvs error console so it is good practice to have a tty open to be informed of things that go wrong.   
* use it to write your own logs.  
* render your ASCII-art.   

**How to open:**  
* Create the <span class="node">Renderer (TTY)</span> node.
