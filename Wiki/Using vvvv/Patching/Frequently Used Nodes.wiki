! Frequently Used Nodes

yea, this is FUN!
this site is about all the lovely nodes a vvvv programmer uses all days. if you are missing one, add it:

^note:
If you add a node, let us know a little about why it's important or what's special/cool/convenient about using it... of course, generalized usage info should go on the corresponding node reference page. But your special trick could go here as well
^

Basics:
((node:IOBox (Value Advanced) )) - create with double right click
((node:Inspektor (VVVV) )) - create with ctrl+i
((node:Renderer (TTY) )) - console, logs errors and infos

Rendering:
((node:Renderer (EX9) ))
((node:Quad (DX9) ))
((node:FileTexture (EX9.Texture) ))
((node:Group (EX9) ))
((node:Transform (Transform 3d) ))
((node:Blend (EX9.RenderState) ))
((node:DX9Texture (EX9.Texture) ))
((node:Homography (Transform 2d) )) - correction of projection in general


Creation:
((node:Random (Value) ))
((node:Map (Value) ))
((node:LFO (Animation) ))
((node:Damper (Animation) ))
((node:LinearSpread (Spreads) ))
((node:RandomSpread (Spreads) ))
((node:CircularSpread (Spreads) ))
((node:GetSlice (Spreads) ))
((node:Count (Value) ))
((node:I (Spreads) ))
((node:Select (Value) ))
((node:Vector (3d Join) ))
((node:Vector (3d Split) ))

Logic:
((node:Change (Animation) ))
((node:TogEdge (Animation) ))
((node:Toggle (Animation)))
((node:FlipFlop (Animation)))
((node:AND (Boolean) ))
((node:OR (Boolean) ))
((node:= (Value) ))
((node:Switch (Value Input) ))
((node:MonoFlop (Animation) ))

Strings:
((node:+ (String) ))
((node:+ (String Spectral) ))
((node:Separate (String) ))
((node:Dir (File) ))
((node:AsValue (String) ))
((node:FormatValue (String) ))

he cracks, please continue...
