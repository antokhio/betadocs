# Boygrouping

![](~/img/Boygrouping-Header3.png "")   

Boygrouping denotes vvvvs built-in client-server architecture. It allows you to control any number of render computers (i.e. clients) from a single server. While you do all the patching only on the server vvvv takes care of all the connected clients to run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSYNC" class="extURL" target="_blank">n'sync</a> Applications of boygrouping are usually multi-screen systems or seamless multi-projection setups.  

In advanced setups it may be necessary that a client listens to multiple servers which can be achieved using [MultiBoygrouping](TODO INTERNALLINK:MultiBoygrouping). But first make sure you understand the classic setup.
