# Remoting Clients



When having to deal with a large number of clients it is often useful to start/stop vvvv.exe or other processes on all of them with just one click from the server.   

Also you may want to reboot/shutdown/WakeOnLAN individual clients or establish a VNC connection to one of them for debugging.   

All this and some more can conveniently be done with our separate tool: [RemoterSA](TODO INTERNALLINK:RemoterSA).  

Alternatively some of those features could be even patched using the Remote Shell node <span class="node">RSh (Network)</span>. Also see [RSH HowTo](TODO INTERNALLINK:RSH HowTo).
