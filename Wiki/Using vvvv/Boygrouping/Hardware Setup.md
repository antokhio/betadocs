# Hardware Setup

A boygroup typically consists of a dedicated server PC and any number of client PCs connected via ethernet. Gigabit connections are of course recommended these days but we've been using boygrouping with vvvv also back when 100baseT was still top of the pops. Wireless works but is not recommended as it will typically see considerable lag and even dropouts.  

The simplest boygroup would consist of only a server and one client pc. In such a setup you could even use the servers fullscreen output as one of the main outputs. However, depending on your patches power consumption (so to speak), this may not be an option. Often the server runs at a lower framerate than the clients, as it has some more work to do.
