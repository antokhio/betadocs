# Installer

* Running the installer prompts you with "User Account Control" confirming its authenticity  
* Simply click through the installer  
* By default vvvv will be installed into **C:\vvvv**, because it won't work in **C:\Program Files**...  
* The Installer optionally installs the addonpack.

#### OS X
Want to run vvvv on your mac? Here is a collection of some   
[Best practices with Bootcamp](TODO INTERNALLINK:best-practices-when-using-bootcamp).  


# Offline Installer

![](~/img/vvvv_folder4.png "")  


* Simply click through the offline Installer  
* The addonpack won't be installed by default  
* If you choose to install the addopack, the installer will download and install it for you. Otherwise you can download the addopack manually and extract it into your vvvv-folder so that the \addonpack directory is placed right next to the \girlpower directory.  



# Start vvvv

![](~/img/vvvv_StartMenu.png "")   
 


* Start vvvv from the "Recently Added" section of the Windows' Start Menu  
* or directly from the vvvv folder on your drive (default is c:\vvvv).  

See the gray window?
