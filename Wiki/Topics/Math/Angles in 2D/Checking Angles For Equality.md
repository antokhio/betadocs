# Checking Angles For Equality

![](~/img/test_2007.04.2015.45.47.jpg "")  
*A rotation of 0.02 equals a rotation of 7.02*  

Since only the fractional part of an angle is responsible for the rotation, many different angles, which only differ in the amount of cycles, can be considered to be the same.  

To check equality of two angles use the <span class="node">= (Value Cyclic)</span>.
