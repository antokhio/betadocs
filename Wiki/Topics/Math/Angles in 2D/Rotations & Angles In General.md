# Rotations & Angles In General

![](~/img/circlecopy.jpg "")  

The most important fact about rotations is that you cannot separate a rotation with an angle of - lets say - 90° from a rotation with an angle of 360°+90° or from a rotation with an angle of 360°+360°+90°...  

All these angles result in the same rotation when applied to a transformation of a particle.  

Maybe you would then just say to yourself: "Ok then, let's just use rotations from 0° to 360°". However sometimes it is very usefull to know that e.g. 353° and 7° are in fact very near together.   

This is more obvious when you just compare the two angles 353° and 360°+7°=367°  
  
  367° - 353° = 14°
  
When you compare these values by subtracting them from each other you see that they are just 14° apart from each other.  

Just keep in mind that angles of any degree make sense (not only those between 0° and 360°) and are valuable to work with (like 367° in our case). We will make benefit from that later.
