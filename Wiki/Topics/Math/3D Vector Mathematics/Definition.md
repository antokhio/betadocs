#  Definition
a vector is an element of vector space. a vector contains the same number of elements than the vector space has dimensions.   

vvvv's vector space is (a numerical approximation to) R3, a 3-dimensional euclidean space of real numbers. so a vvvvector is a set of three numbers (x, y, z) of 3d vvvvector space of vvvv numbers.
