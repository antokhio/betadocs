# Mixed Approaches



* You can use the Timeliner to define some crucial states of the values in time and let the [Time-based Nodes](xref:f03b2df4-e4b6-45c4-a48e-ac50b7b810b4) do the job to smoothen the transitions.  

* The other way around: you can have several nicely animated timelines (or several animation states on one timeline) and trigger them when a certain condition is met. This condition can depend on a time- or frame-based animation.
