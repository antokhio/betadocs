!Abstract

We will discuss in which cases frame based animations are needed and compare  them with time based animations. We'll also compare the feedback / Framedelay concept with similar concepts like global variables or states (in other languages) and have a look at examples for frame based algorithms. We'll then dive into how feedback systems in vvvv should look like and how they can be controlled and kept easy - even when the demands / outcome are getting more complex. 

!Requirements

Basic vvvv knowledge and interest in reducing complex behaviour into small patches.
