# Abstract

We will discuss in which cases frame based animations are needed and compare  them with time based animations. We'll also compare the feedback / Framedelay concept with similar concepts like global variables or states (in other languages) and have a look at examples for frame based algorithms. We'll then dive into how feedback systems in vvvv should look like and how they can be controlled and kept easy - even when the demands / outcome are getting more complex.   

# Requirements

Basic vvvv knowledge and interest in reducing complex behaviour into small patches.

Sebastian Gregor (aka gregsn) is a member of the vvvv group and went the way along most of the incarnations of “vvvv” as an active developer.  

Tebjan Halm (aka tonfilm) is closely related to the vvvv group since 2004 as an active developer.
