# VST Instruments

**VAudio**  
The <a href="https://vvvv.org/contribution/vvvv.audio-pack-alpha" class="extURL contribution" target="_blank">VAudio pack</a> has a newer VST integration which also works with 64bit vvvv.  

**Legacy**  
See the [VST-guide](TODO INTERNALLINK:VST) about VST Instruments in vvvv.  

Examples:  
* \girlpower\Audio folder in your vvvv directory  
* \girlpower folder in the VVVV.Audio pack directory
