!!ASIO
Audio Stream Input/Output (ASIO) is a computer sound card driver protocol for digital audio specified by Steinberg, providing a low-latency and high fidelity interface between a software application and a computer's sound card. Whereas Microsoft's DirectSound is commonly used as an intermediary signal path for non-professional users, ASIO allows musicians and sound engineers to access external hardware directly.

While most consumer sound cards do not come with ASIO drivers, there is a generic ASIO driver available that works with most sound cards [http://www.asio4all.com/|ASIO4ALL].
