# Intro


When dealing with audio in vvvv you have to choose between the nodes in the categories listed to the right.  

All worlds have their advantages and drawbacks and they donâ€™t interoperate.  

Frankly speaking, vvvv is not focused on audio processing. For maximum flexibility in handling sound you'd probably want to get dirty with <a href="http://puredata.info/" class="extURL" target="_blank">Pure Data</a>.  



* **DShow9:** Native audio processing nodes in the DShow9 category are based on DirectShow.  
---  
* **VAudio:** The <a href="https://vvvv.org/contribution/vvvv.audio-pack-alpha" class="extURL contribution" target="_blank">VVVV.Audio pack</a> gives the most flexible and transparent routing options along with strong VST and ASIO driver support.  
---  
* **Bass:** Nodes of this category are based on the Bass audio library. The Bass nodes are contributed by <span class="user"><a href="https://vvvv.org/users/vux" class="extURL" target="_blank">vux</a></span> and are coming with the <a href="https://vvvv.org/downloads#addonpack" class="extURL" target="_blank">addonpack</a>.  
---  
* **irrKlang:** vvvv support of the <a href="http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/" class="extURL" target="_blank">irrKlang</a> 2d/3d sound library. The Irrklang node is contributed by <span class="user"><a href="https://vvvv.org/users/sanch" class="extURL" target="_blank">sanch</a></span> and is coming with the <a href="https://vvvv.org/downloads#addonpack" class="extURL" target="_blank">addonpack</a>.
