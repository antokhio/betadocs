vvvv can talk to Photoshop running on any networked machine. Images can be sent to and requested from Photoshop.   

Photoshop understands JavaScript (manipulate Layers, Groups, SmartObjects, Filters, Adjustment and Text layers; Open/Save/Export documents, ... you name it), vvvv offers a simple way to send these commands and receive responses.  

The convenient <span class="node">Photoshop (EX9.Texture)</span> automatically pulls an image from Photoshop when any change was made to a document.
