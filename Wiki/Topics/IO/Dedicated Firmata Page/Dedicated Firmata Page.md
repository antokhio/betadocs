# Dedicated Firmata Page

Firmata is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a computer (or smartphone/tablet, etc).  

The <span class="node">FirmataBoard (Devices)</span> node is able to talk to any microcontroller board (like Arduino, Teensy, Particle.io, ...) that is loaded with the Firmata firmware or uses the Firmata library.  

For example, this is how to setup an Arduino Board:  
* Open the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software" class="extURL" target="_blank">Arduino IDE</a>, choose File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata.   
* Choose your 'Board' and the 'Port' under the 'Tools'.   
* Click Upload. Your Arduino is ready.
