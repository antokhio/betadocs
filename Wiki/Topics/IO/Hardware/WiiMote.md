The WiiMote can be accessed from vvvv via the <span class="node">WiiMote (Devices)</span> node. Check its helppatch to learn how to use it.  

**The <span class="node">WiiMote (Devices)</span> is contributed by <span class="user"><a href="https://vvvv.org/users/velcrome" class="extURL" target="_blank">velcrome</a></span> and is coming with the <a href="https://vvvv.org/downloads#addonpack" class="extURL" target="_blank">addonpack</a>.**  

Note, there are at least 3 types of the WiiMote out there:  
(The *code* can be found on the battery compartment)  
* the classic WiiMote with no MotionPlus, this works with vvvv  
* the new WiiMote with builtin MotionPlus, *code* is LMB-RVL-WR/M-C0 (and C2) works with vvvv, but no MotionPlus, if you need MotionPlus use <a href="http://glovepie.org/" class="extURL" target="_blank">GlovePIE</a>, fully working there  
* the latest WiiMote with builtin MotionPlus, *code* is LMB-RVL-WR/Z-C4 (and C6) does not connect with vvvv, with GlovePIE you get partial data, connectivity is buggy, it has a reset button on the plastic battery cover so that it can be reset without removing the cover.
