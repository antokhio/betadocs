# Text as a layer


#### Related nodes
<span class="node">Text (EX9)</span>  
<span class="node">Billboard (Transform)</span>

The simplest way to draw text is using <span class="node">Text (EX9)</span> which returns a layer that can be directly connected to the Renderer. Note how the nodes <span class="pin">Size</span> by default does not actually change the texts size but rather its resolution. See the nodes helppatch in order to learn how to specify the size in pixels.
