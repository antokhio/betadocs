<span class="node">Text (EX9.Texture Source)</span>  



The <span class="node">Text (EX9.Texture)</span> has almost the same functionality as the native <span class="node">Text (EX9)</span> but returns texture with a text drawn on transparent background. This texture can then be applied to any geometry or primitives like <span class="node">Quad (DX9)</span> in order to be rendered.  

The <span class="node">Text (EX9.Texture Source)</span> is also a simple text to texture renderer.
