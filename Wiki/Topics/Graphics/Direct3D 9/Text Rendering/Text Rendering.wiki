The simplest way to draw text is using ((node:Text (EX9))) which returns a layer that can be directly connected to the Renderer. Note how the nodes ((pin:Size)) by default does not actually change the texts size but rather its resolution. See the nodes helppatch in order to learn how to specify the size in pixels.

!Text as a texture
{SPLIT()}

((node:Text (EX9.Texture)))
((node:Text (EX9.Texture Source)))

~~~

The ((node:Text (EX9.Texture))) has almost the same functionality as the native ((node:Text (EX9))) but returns texture with a text drawn on transparent background. This texture can then be applied to any geometry or primitives like ((node:Quad (DX9))) in order to be rendered.

The ((node:Text (EX9.Texture Source))) is also a simple text to texture renderer.

!Text as 3d geometry

!!!!Related nodes
((node:Text (EX9.Geometry)))

~~~

((node:Text (EX9.Geometry))) returns text as geometry. But note that since ((/blog/vvvv45beta32|45beta32)) this node is no longer available by default. 

Read more about the ((/blog/updates-regarding-windows-8.1#dx9ex|/dx9ex commandline parameter)) to understand why and learn how to make the node work again.

!Rendering HTML & Flash text

!!!!Related nodes
((node:HTMLTexture (EX9.Texture String)))

((node:Renderer (Flash)))

~~~

A text layout made in HTML or Flash can be rendered to a texture using ((node:HTMLTexture (EX9.Texture URL))). Note that you don't need the Renderer (Flash) because ((node:HTMLTexture (EX9.Texture URL))) renders it all..

__HTMLTexture nodes are coming with the ((downloads|addonpack)).__

~~~

Another way to layout and render the text is to use SVG.

SVGs can be created on the fly using the nodes from the SVG category or be prepared beforehand in your favorite Vector-based editing program and then just loaded as SVG-files using the ((node:Reader (SVG))).
