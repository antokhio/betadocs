Geometries from the 'EX9.Geometry' category are only 3d meshes, they need an Effect (from the 'EX9.Effect' category) to be drawn.  

Effects are containers for user-programmable vertex- and pixelshader, which in turn represent the two steps in which drawing is performed. See the [Shader](TODO INTERNALLINK:Shader) section for more on those.
