There are many different options to play  
* videos   
* stacks of images  
* live streams  
in vvvv. See the [video](TODO INTERNALLINK:video) section for details on the different options. In any case at some point the video will finally be available as texture which you can place on a [geometry](TODO INTERNALLINK:geometry) in order to render it.   

Examples in your vvvv\girlpower\ directory:  
* Graphics\DX9\Textures\
