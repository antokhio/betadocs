#### Related nodes
<span class="node">DynamicTexture (EX9.Texture Color)</span>  
<span class="node">DynamicTexture (EX9.Texture Raw)</span>  
<span class="node">DynamicTexture (EX9.Texture Value)</span>  
<span class="node">DX9Texture (EX9.Texture)</span>  
<span class="node">FrameDelay (EX9.Texture)</span>  



In order to create textures on the fly use one of the DynamicTexture nodes and supply data for each pixel.  

Or render a scene (first pass) and using the <span class="node">DX9Texture (EX9.Texture)</span> feed it as a texture into another scene (second pass).  

Examples in your vvvv\girlpower\ directory:  
* Graphics\DX9\Textures
