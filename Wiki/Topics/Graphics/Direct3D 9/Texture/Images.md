The <span class="node">FileTexture (EX9.Texture)</span> can load images of different formats:  *.bmp, *.dds, *.jpg, *.png, *.tga, *.tif. To render the texture it must be applied to a [geometry](TODO INTERNALLINK:geometry).   

Want to preload a large number of textures? See the helppatch of <span class="node">Preloader (EX9.Texture)</span> to learn how.
