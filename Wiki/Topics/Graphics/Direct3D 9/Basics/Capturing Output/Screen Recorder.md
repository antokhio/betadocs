* Use <span class="node">Rekorder (Windows)</span> to capture ANY window into an animated GIF. The <span class="pin">Progress</span> output helps to create seamless animated loops. Use **Ctrl+4** to capture an active window.   

* There are also several screen capture tools listed on the [video software links](TODO INTERNALLINK:video software links) page that can record portions of the screen to a movie file.   

* Alternatively you can also use <span class="node">ScreenShot (EX9.Texture)</span> in connection with a <span class="node">Writer (EX9.Texture)</span> and patch your own screen recorder.
