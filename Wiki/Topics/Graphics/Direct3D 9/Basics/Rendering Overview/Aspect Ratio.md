# Aspect Ratio


![](~/img/Basics-AspectRatio4.png "")   



The <span class="pin">Aspect Ratio</span> transformation on the Renderer (hidden by default) is used to sqeeze/stretch the coordinate system of the renderer so that the proportions of the window have no effect on the image.  

The coordinate system of the Renderer is stretched vertically as a countermeasure to its horizontally stretched window.  

Check the helppatch of the <span class="node">AspectRatio (Transform)</span>.
