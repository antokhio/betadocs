# Rotation

![](~/img/Cycles1.png "")  


In vvvv rotations are specified in fractions of full counter-clockwise cycles (turns).   

 0° = 0 cycles
 90° = 0.25 cycles
 180° = 0.5 cycles
 270° = 0.75 cycles
 360° = 1 cycle
 720° = 2 cycles
 ...

Search the NodeBrowser for *Cycles*, *Degrees* or *Radians* to find nodes that convert between the different scales.
