# SVG
As of beta27 vvvv ships with a set of nodes for reading, writing and displaying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics" class="extURL" target="_blank">SVG</a> documents.   

## Coordinate System
Note that the y-axis in the SVG coordinate system is flipped compared to the default vvvv coordinate system. The reason for this is that vvvv here adapts to the coordinate system as specified by SVG in order to make exchange with files saved in other vector graphic editors straightforward.
