In order to apply physical behaviour (gravity, collision, ..) to geometry you have the choice between different [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine|physics engines] implemented in vvvv.

Use the nodes in the ''Box2d'' category for animating 2d geometry.

If for whatever reason none of the above works for you have a look at vvvvs native (but rather legacy) implementation of the ''Open Dynamics Engine'' in the ''ODE'' category of nodes. For those nodes check their ((glossary:helppatches)).
