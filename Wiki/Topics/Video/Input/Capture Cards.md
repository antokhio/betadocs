# Capture Cards




Capture Cards either come with a WDM driver or a proprietary API. In the first case simply use the <span class="node"> VideoIn (DShow9)</span> to access them, in the second case you'll have to write your own [plugin](TODO INTERNALLINK:plugins) in order to to implement the API.
