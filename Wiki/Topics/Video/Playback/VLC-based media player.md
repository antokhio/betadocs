The <span class="node">FileStream (EX9.Texture VLC)</span> plays back all the codecs the VLC Media Player does.  

Its <span class="pin">Filename</span> pin is spreadable, so the node can read several videos at the same time and return their frames as a spread of textures.  

**The VLC node is contributed by <span class="user"><a href="https://vvvv.org/users/ft" class="extURL" target="_blank">ft</a></span> and is coming with the <a href="https://vvvv.org/downloads#addonpack" class="extURL" target="_blank">addonpack</a>.**  

note:  
The <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" class="extURL" target="_blank">VLC Player</a> has to be installed on the system in order for the node to work.
