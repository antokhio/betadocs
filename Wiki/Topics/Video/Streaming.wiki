A texture can be sent over the network using either the MJpegStream nodes or ((software#spout|Spout)) in connection with [http://techlife.sg/TCPSpout/|TCPSpout].

Alternatively you can convert a texture to a byte-spread using AsRaw (EX9.Texture) and send it over the network, eg. via ((protocols#udp-tcp|TCP)) and convert the byte-spread back to a texture using DynamicTexture (EX9.Texture Raw).

For local texture sharing between different instances of vvvv or even other softwares you can ((software#spout|Spout)) or simple texture sharing via SharedTexture (EX9.Texture). See its helppatch for a demo.
