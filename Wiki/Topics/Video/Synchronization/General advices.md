# General advices
* Make sure videos you want to sync all have equal length and the same codec.   

* Disable features like "CPU SpeedStep" that adapt the speed of the CPU.  The videosync algorithm uses the high resolution performance counter of your cpu to calculate timing. This can become unreliable when the bios changes the cpu speed to save power or performance.   

* Syncing does not seem to work for audio. Needs more investigation...
