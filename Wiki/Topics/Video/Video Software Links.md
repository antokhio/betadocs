## Video Tools
* <a href="http://mpc-hc.org/" class="extURL" target="_blank"> MPC-HC Lightweight Mediaplayer</a> does away with the clutter of Quicktime or Windows MPlayer2.  
* <a href="http://virtualdub.sourceforge.net/" class="extURL" target="_blank"> VirtualDub</a> - the swiss army knife of video converters. Does not do Quicktime, though, unless you use AviSynth. There is also [VirtualDubMod] that supports MPEG-2, but is slow, does not do frame-accurate editing, and will require a separate AC3 codec (see below)  
* <a href="http://www.womble.com" class="extURL" target="_blank">MPEG Video Wizard</a> - (Trialware, about 100â‚¬). 90% of all users will never need another video editor. Ever tried editing a VOB file with AC-3 in Premiere, Vegas, or Avid? Womble does it. Smart recompression avoidance, superb MPEG2 scrubbing. Looks ugly, but so does final cut.

* <a href="http://www.dvbviewer.tv/forum/topic/2543-radlight-filter-manager-v16/page-2#entry139116" class="extURL" target="_blank">RadLight filter manager</a> is a nice little tool for setting the merit of codecs and for getting the big picture of what's installed on your system. It helped me to regain power over my explorer's thumbnail view- after installing the k-lite codec pack the ffwdshow codec took over all MP1, MP2 and MP4 files and would not show me any thumbnails in explorer any more. Unregistering ffwdshow did the trick immediately. So would (I presume) setting the merit to DO_NOT_USE.
