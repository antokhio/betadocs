### Automata
Use <span class="node">Automata (Animation)</span> for complex logical structures. Automata allows you to distill complex logic into a textual description. See it's extensive helppatch.  

[Qfsm graphical tool](TODO INTERNALLINK:GraphicalAutomata) is good for drawing State Machines, it allows you to export state machine statements for the <span class="node">Automata (Animation)</span>.  

### Automata UI
There is also a much more convenient <a href="https://vvvv.org/contribution/automata-ui" class="extURL contribution" target="_blank">Automata UI</a> contributed by <span class="user"><a href="https://vvvv.org/users/u7angel" class="extURL" target="_blank">u7angel</a></span> which enables you to design your program logic with states and transitions as well as giving them a duration within a visual editor.  

### Sequence based logic
Use <span class="node">Timeliner (Animation)</span> for more sequence based logic. It has an Automata track to jump in the timeline. [How to use Timeliner](TODO INTERNALLINK:timelinersa).
