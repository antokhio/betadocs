# Introduction
In this tutorial we'll take you step by step through your first pixel- and vertexshaders. The good thing with shaders is that the basics are really simple. There are actually not many things you need to know about. And even for realizing more advanced stuff (like lighting) the principles are the same and you only need a better understanding of the [math](TODO INTERNALLINK:math) involved, which is a different story.  

So lets start with getting the vocabulary straight:  

In Direct3D (which vvvvs render engine is based on) pixel- and vertexshaders are dealt with in so called Effects. Before reading any further we'd recommend you to check the [Graphics](TODO INTERNALLINK:Graphics) section of the documentation and read through the EX9... links you find there to get a basic overview of the topic. Or at least if you're not in the mood to read that now make sure to check back there as soon as specific questions arise.
