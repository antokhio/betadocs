# Geometry Morphing
 
be it image or geometry. morphing is cool. since morphing/blending geometry is actually quite simple to achieve with vvvv if you understand the basics here comes a little tutorial.  

there are basically 2 approaches.   
* the slower [cpu based](TODO INTERNALLINK:Tutorial Geometry Morphing CPU) way (good enough for simple things)  
* the cooler gpu based way (cool for many other things)  
  * using [basic vertex shading](TODO INTERNALLINK:Tutorial Geometry Morphing GPU1)  

for a basic understanding best start with the [cpu based](TODO INTERNALLINK:Tutorial Geometry Morphing CPU) approach!  


**don't be fooled by the boring screenshots! load your own meshes with <span class="node">XFile (EX9.Geometry Load)</span> to have more fun during the tutorials!!**
