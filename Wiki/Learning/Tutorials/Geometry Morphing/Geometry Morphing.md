# Geometry Morphing
 
be it image or geometry. morphing is cool. since morphing/blending geometry is actually quite simple to achieve with vvvv if you understand the basics here comes a little tutorial.  

there are basically 2 approaches.   
* the slower [the other](xref:772f4282-a62a-467a-938a-d3f69bf3f57b) way (good enough for simple things)  
* the cooler gpu based way (cool for many other things)  
  * using [gpu based](xref:a1af3b44-af68-4ce5-8a46-57a0561596f9)  

for a basic understanding best start with the [the other](xref:772f4282-a62a-467a-938a-d3f69bf3f57b) approach!  


**don't be fooled by the boring screenshots! load your own meshes with <span class="node">XFile (EX9.Geometry Load)</span> to have more fun during the tutorials!!**
