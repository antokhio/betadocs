be it image or geometry. morphing is cool. since morphing/blending geometry is actually quite simple to achieve with vvvv if you understand the basics here comes a little tutorial.

there are basically 2 approaches. 
* the slower ((Tutorial Geometry Morphing CPU|cpu based)) way (good enough for simple things)
* the cooler gpu based way (cool for many other things)
** varianta 1: using ((Tutorial Geometry Morphing GPU1|basic vertex shading))
** varianta 2: using ((Tutorial Geometry Morphing GPU2|advanced vertex shading))

for a basic understanding best start with the ((Tutorial Geometry Morphing CPU|cpu based)) approach!


__don't be fooled by the boring screenshots! load your own meshes with ((node:XFile (EX9.Geometry Load) )) to have more fun during the tutorials!!__
