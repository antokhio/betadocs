kirill named his work "big fish". a real (slightly too big) fish is being tracked. the movement information retrieved moves around a video on screen that shows the interview of a wellknown moldavian art-critic being interviewed.
the right picture shows kirill himself being interviewd about his work by moldavian state television.
