!Cloning an Effect
When starting to create a new effect it is often helpful to work from an existing one. In the EX9.Effect node category you can find the Template (EX9.Effect) which is such a good starting point (but you can also start from any other effect in the category). 
* hover the effect in the NodeBrowser
* press CTRL+Enter or CTRL+Click to clone it
* specify a name 
* if your patch is not yet saved you'll also have to specify a path for the cloned effect to be copied to
* rightlclick the newly created node in order to edit its code

!Learning about effects

* For an introduction to the technology behind Effects follow the EX9 links in the ((shader#custom-effects|Shader)) section of the documentation.
