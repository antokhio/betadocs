# Cloning an Effect
When starting to create a new effect it is often helpful to work from an existing one. In the EX9.Effect node category you can find the Template (EX9.Effect) which is such a good starting point (but you can also start from any other effect in the category).   
* hover the effect in the NodeBrowser  
* press CTRL+Enter or CTRL+Click to clone it  
* specify a name   
* if your patch is not yet saved you'll also have to specify a path for the cloned effect to be copied to  
* rightlclick the newly created node in order to edit its code  

# Learning about effects
* For a tutorial introducing VVVVs shader language and techniques see the [Tutorial of Effects and Shaders](TODO INTERNALLINK:tutorial-of-effects-and-shaders)  
* For an introduction to the technology behind Effects follow the EX9 links in the [Shader](TODO INTERNALLINK:shader#custom-effects) section of the documentation.
