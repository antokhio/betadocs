Libraries of classes are categorized using Namespaces. vvvv provides a small collection of useable classes, .net itself comes with a huge collection of ready to use classes.
~~~
^note:
If you use a namespace which is documented in one of the following class references and get an error after saving your plugin, you once have to add a reference to the namespace's dll in vvvv (see below). 
^

!The VVVV namespace
{SPLIT()}
((/pluginspecs|Complete vvvv class library reference))
~~~
Especially useful are:
* __VVVV.Utils.VMath__: for all stuff not found in System.Math
* __VVVV.Utils.Animation__: provides a Particle baseclass

!The .NET namespace

[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg145045.aspx|Complete .net4.0 class library reference]
~~~
Especially useful are:
*__System.Collections.Generic__: List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>
*__System.Collections__: IEnumerable
*__System.XML__: for xml parsing and writing, xslt, xpath..and more
*__System.IO__: for file reading and writing and filename and directory handling

!Add a namespace's reference

~~~
* Open vvvv's ProjectExplorer by pressing ctrl+J and then navigate to your appropiate dynamic plugin within the shown list. The missing namespace which causes the error should also miss in the list entry 'References'. 
* Click right and add the reference as shown in the screenshot.
