Any of the ((glossary:directshow)) filters coded for use with vvvv are opensource and may be used as they are in any other application that supports directshow. They are written in delphi or c++.

[https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk/tree/develop/vvvv45/src/nodes/directshowfilter|github source view of vvvv directshow filters]

One additional filter, the DSFreeFrameWrapper, which allows you to use freeframe effects in any directshow graph can be found in the [http://freeframe.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freeframe/trunk/DSFreeFrameWrapper|Freeframe svn repository].

If you have a directshow filter you want to use with vvvv this is not possible out of the box. Integration of filters requires some coding on the vvvv-side. Please direct such requests to devvvvs”òvvvv.org
