# Addons Directshow Filter
Any of the directshow filters coded for use with vvvv are opensource and may be used as they are in any other application that supports directshow. They are written in delphi or c++.

One additional filter, the DSFreeFrameWrapper, which allows you to use freeframe effects in any directshow graph can be found in the <a href="http://freeframe.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/freeframe/trunk/DSFreeFrameWrapper" class="extURL" target="_blank">Freeframe svn repository</a>.  

If you have a directshow filter you want to use with vvvv this is not possible out of the box. Integration of filters requires some coding on the vvvv-side. Please direct such requests to devvvvs”òvvvv.org
