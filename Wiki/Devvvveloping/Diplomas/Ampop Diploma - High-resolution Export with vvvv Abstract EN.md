#  Cross-media documentation of the node based programming environment vvvv
##  From the fundamental functions and logics of the software to the practical use in production environments with a special look upon graphic- and motion design.

Creation of a well designed manual/compendium with all necessary information to allow beginners to understand and gain access to the possibilities vvvv has to offer by extracting and enhancing content taken from the vvvv webpage.  
One part of the manual will cover special topics like live visualisations, dynamic graphic design and the creation of OnAir/OnDemand streams in a comprehensive manner.  
A goal is, to create the whole manual at least semi automatically from the website with a dynamic and pretty random design that follows certain rules to establish a certain look without compromising readability.  

A more accurate describtion is only available in german right now...
