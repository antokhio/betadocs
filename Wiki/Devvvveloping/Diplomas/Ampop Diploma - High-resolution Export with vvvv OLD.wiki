This Section of the vvvv webpage will be dedicated to my diploma for which I intend to compile and design a printable vvvv Manual.

! First thougts
All the text formally present on this site, was moved one level deeper: ((ampop_diploma_first_thoughts|Read it here))

Furthermore, there exists a short english abstract and a longer german version:
((de.ampop_diploma_abstract|vvvv Manual Abstract (german) )) 
((ampop_diploma_abstract|vvvv Manual Abstract (english) ))  

! Design studies 
For printer friendlyness, I would prefer the book to be A4, but in landscape format as this is a typical format for a manual.

! Character styles
Working with the xml templates made me think about the various formatting styles we may need to use in the manual. I will make a separate page to discuss them later on, right now I need to find out, how many different formatting styles will be needed.
Add more styles or comment like you wish!

* Big Headlines for Chapters
* Smaller Headlines inside Paragraphs
* The style for long texts
* Bold
* Italic
* a style for hyperlinks
* Footnotes

! Research
* ((ampop_diploma_xml research|First tests of InDesign's xml im- and export functions))

! The two parts (stubs!)
NB: Before reading the things regarding the two parts of the manual, please read the "First Thoughts" and maybe the Abstract...
