# Ampop Diploma - High-resolution Export with vvvv OLD
This Section of the vvvv webpage will be dedicated to my diploma for which I intend to compile and design a printable vvvv Manual.  

#  First thougts
All the text formally present on this site, was moved one level deeper: [Read it here](xref:6a2c4675-0f16-425e-9b07-b687ce9cc2d4)  

Furthermore, there exists a short english abstract and a longer german version:

#  Design studies 
For printer friendlyness, I would prefer the book to be A4, but in landscape format as this is a typical format for a manual.

#  Character styles
Working with the xml templates made me think about the various formatting styles we may need to use in the manual. I will make a separate page to discuss them later on, right now I need to find out, how many different formatting styles will be needed.  
Add more styles or comment like you wish!  

* Big Headlines for Chapters  
* Smaller Headlines inside Paragraphs  
* The style for long texts  
* Bold  
* Italic  
* a style for hyperlinks  
* Footnotes  

#  Research
* [First tests of InDesign's xml im- and export functions](xref:0e5de704-3c07-4e42-8ce8-6ab665ebccf6)
