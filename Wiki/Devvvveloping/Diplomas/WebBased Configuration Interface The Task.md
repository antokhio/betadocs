# The Task

Based on the existing HTTP server node implementation, vvvv should be extended to get a node set which makes it dead easy to create configuration pages for setting system configuration data via a standard web browser. VVVV is used at many places for permanent media installations and integrated media systems, and there is an increasing need for configuration screens to allow untrained personal to change and monitor basic settings or update the systems with new content.  

Scope of the thesis would include a deriving a basic node set for creating checkboxes, buttons, sliders, text fields, color pickers and comboboxes on the configuration web pages, and have the user input available on an output pin. Data should be automatically persistent and written to the disk, so that no additional code for storing configuration data between sessions is necessary. A system for structuring the web page with Tabs or multiple URLs should be included.  

In addition to the nodes for basic data types, a framework for more advanced but reusable user interaction concepts e.g. playlists, image lists, calendars, drag&drop placement of objects and markers on a stage, data upload etc. should be developed using AJAX technologies
