# Msberger Modules Devices DMX4allRS232
**DMX RS232 board DMX4all**  

This DMX-interface is a cheap, very simple and not very fast but good and stable working DIY-interface controlled via RS232. It is DMX-OUT only.  
More information about this interface can be found at <a href="http://www.dmx4all.de/dmx411.php" class="extURL" target="_blank">http://www.dmx4all.de/dmx411.php</a>  
The following patches write data to the interface in block transmission mode what is much faster than the ASCII mode.  
Due to some changes in the +(String Spectral) node in vvvv33beta8 there are two different modules for download.
