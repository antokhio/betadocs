__DMX RS232 board DMX4all__

This DMX-interface is a cheap, very simple and not very fast but good and stable working DIY-interface controlled via RS232. It is DMX-OUT only.
More information about this interface can be found at [http://www.dmx4all.de/dmx411.php|http://www.dmx4all.de/dmx411.php]
The following patches write data to the interface in block transmission mode what is much faster than the ASCII mode.
Due to some changes in the +(String Spectral) node in vvvv33beta8 there are two different modules for download.
