# About Addons
vvvv itself is not open source, but it offers different open interfaces for people to write their own nodes:  

[Plugins](TODO INTERNALLINK - Plugins): most general interface for writing multipurpose nodes   
[Freeframes](TODO INTERNALLINK - Freeframes): video effects/analysis nodes  
[Effects](TODO INTERNALLINK - Effects): vertex- and pixelshader  
[Modules](TODO INTERNALLINK - Modules): reusable vvvv-patches  
[VST](TODO INTERNALLINK - VST): audio effects/analysis nodes  

Many users share their work mostly under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" class="extURL" target="_blank">LGPL</a> opensource license. Those nodes, not being part of the main executable are called *addons* and their sources are being hosted on <a href="https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk" class="extURL" target="_blank">github</a>  

All contributed addons are available via a separately downloadable [addonpack](TODO INTERNALLINK:About the Addonpack) in order to allow independent release cycles of the main vvvv application and user submitted content.
