# About Addons
vvvv itself is not open source, but it offers different open interfaces for people to write their own nodes:  

[Plugins](xref:766d8ac2-5145-417d-b2df-37d24e3b2b6f): most general interface for writing multipurpose nodes   
[Freeframes](xref:2ead0175-8c97-4f9c-ba48-6b4235f4328c): video effects/analysis nodes  
[Effects](xref:7aa93595-ec96-4758-8076-0e00e4cf8bf6): vertex- and pixelshader  
[Modules](xref:be2a7b95-9a02-4bdf-8506-e10292de80f4): reusable vvvv-patches  
[VST](xref:3d0e7863-48f9-4bf9-bd83-c3ecc1f29ca8): audio effects/analysis nodes  

Many users share their work mostly under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" class="extURL" target="_blank">LGPL</a> opensource license. Those nodes, not being part of the main executable are called *addons* and their sources are being hosted on <a href="https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk" class="extURL" target="_blank">github</a>  

All contributed addons are available via a separately downloadable [addonpack](xref:e1554948-8a15-4e39-8289-59216c388376) in order to allow independent release cycles of the main vvvv application and user submitted content.
