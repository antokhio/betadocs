# About Tags
## How to Tag Q&A Threads and Addons

the following rule-set is ripped from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" class="extURL" target="_blank">stackoverflow</a> (with small modifications):  

> 
A tag is a keyword or label that categorizes your question with other, similar questions.  
* favor existing popular tags  
* avoid creating new tags  
* combine multiple words into single-words with dashes  
* maximum of 5 tags  
* maximum of 25 chars per tag  
* tag characters: [[a-z 0-9 + # - .]  
* delimit tags by comma  
  

## Additional rule for tagging vvvv Addons
* don't use any terms already present in the nodes *Name*, *Category* or *Version* as a tag  
  * e.g. a node like <span class="node">FileTexture (EX9.Texture)</span> does neither need the word *file* nor the word *texture* as a tag
