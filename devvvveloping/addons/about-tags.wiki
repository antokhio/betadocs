!!How to Tag Q&A Threads and Addons

the following rule-set is ripped from [http://stackoverflow.com|stackoverflow] (with small modifications):

^
A tag is a keyword or label that categorizes your question with other, similar questions.
* favor existing popular tags
* avoid creating new tags
* combine multiple words into single-words with dashes
* maximum of 5 tags
* maximum of 25 chars per tag
* tag characters: [[a-z 0-9 + # - .]
* delimit tags by comma
^

!!Additional rule for tagging vvvv Addons
* don't use any terms already present in the nodes ''Name'', ''Category'' or ''Version'' as a tag
** e.g. a node like ((node:FileTexture (EX9.Texture))) does neither need the word ''file'' nor the word ''texture'' as a tag
