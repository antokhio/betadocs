In contrast to a Help Patch, the Node Reference Page on the Wiki should contain reference material and discussions. Node Reference and Help Patch are complementary, they are not supposed to replace each other.
A good node reference page should contain

* links to external web pages describing the workings and the context of the node (eg. wikipedia, microsofts directx reference etc)
* reference material on the nodeÂ´s internal workings like source code fragments, diagrams and tables
* a FAQ section
* known bugs and workarounds
* links to supplementary modules and related nodes
* changes to the semantics of the node in various releases
* a backlink section which lists all places in the wiki and in the forum, where the node is mentioned in context.
