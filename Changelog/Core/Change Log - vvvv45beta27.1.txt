released on 20 02 12 

!!general
* no longer needs .net3.5SP1 installed to run, .net4 is enough
* no more troubles with "missing" nodes with plugins actually present
* if exception dialog is visible mainloop of vvvv will be stopped

!!fixed nodes
* CreateNode and GetPatch failed in b27
* MonitorPower (System) works again
* VideoIn (DShow9) got a problem fixed with switching between 2 drivers
* FileStream2 (DShow9) failed to run on some systems
* Finally (VVVV) now works as advertised
* Random (Value) in integermode didn't equally distribute random values
* Undistort (DShow9 OpenCV) got its Rows/Columns inputs fixed 
* Substitute (Spreads) was broken if patch contained a Sift (Value) node
* Database (MySQL Network) works again
* Mesh (EX9.Geometry Join) and VertexBuffer (EX9.Geometry Join) now dont evaluate upstream graphs when apply = false and therefore are very fast in those cases. S+H and Switch tricks not needed anylonger.
* LinearFilter (Animation): fixed a bug: ((forum:spread->-linearfilter-does-not-filter-linearly))
* Renderer (Flash): fixed bug: ((forum:which-flash-player-version))
* Automata (Logic): fixed bug: ((forum:automata-state-pin-problem))
* Quad (SVG): fixed corner radius bug: ((forum:renderer-%28svg%29-quad-%28svg%29-corner-radius))
 
!!changed nodes
* added ((pin:Scratching)) output to Timeliner that reports when the timebar is being draged
* VideoTexture (EX9.Texture): added an adapter pin, that allows you to specify on which adapter the texture should run.

!!new nodes
* DeleteSlice, deletes slices of a spread at the given index

!!plugininterface
* direct3d9 interface change: ((blog:direct3d9-plugin-interface-change))
* new interface IStartable, which can be used to run some initialization code when vvvv starts up / shuts down or plugin assembly gets loaded
* ISpread<Quaternion> and ISpread<Color4> from SlimDX can now be imported by a plugin
* in some circumstance IPluginDXResource.UpdateResource was called multiple times per device. this happended for example if a Renderer and an Info node were connected downstream.
