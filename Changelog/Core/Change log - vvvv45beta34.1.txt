!!general 
* IOBoxes come with a hidden "Changed" pin. ((forum:changed-pin-on-ioboxes))
* remote controlling: fix: ((forum:server-(vvvv)-exposed-iobox-string-behaviour))
* fix for abstract node connections when routed over e.g. Switch (Node): ((forum:node-type-pins-connection-and-type-names-broken))
* if corrupt patch file can't be loaded -> red node (instead of missing node)
* failable nodes like division node, mod node and several spectral nodes now get red on a division by zero. additionally you get a fast method of how to ignore those errors if this is what you want. the success pin gives you the opportunity to react otherwise on unsuccessful operations.
* NAN, INF, MaxFloat (..) may be specified whereever you expect a number. 
* fixed a problem with unicode characters in xml-snippets: ((forum:(send)xml-inconsistency))
* fixed a problem with node-label redrawing: ((forum:labelpin-vs-gui-redraw))
