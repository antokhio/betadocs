* Update to latest RCPSharp
* Fixes for Spout thanks to a [https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk/pull/293|PR by @leadedge]
* Fixed regression introduced in beta39 crashing vvvv when putting a DX11 renderer into boxed mode. This bug was also present in earlier versions but only harder to reproduce, one had to create a Keyboard (Window) node BEFORE creating the renderer.
