!!general
* crack.exe is now setup.exe
* vvvv is now dpiAware meaning it works at any OS zoomlevel
* vvvv now defaults to /dx9ex, can still fall back to /dx9
* fixed memory leak when using /dx9ex and moving renderer window to different screen
* fixed small memory leak while patching introduced in beta29
* node in debug mode gets drawn in different colors if it writes to the log
* route more exceptions in DX9 pipeline through LogErrorFmt method which invokes exception dialog
* log will now include node address (if available) and will append the stack trace otherwise only available through the exception dialog
* user contributed packs can now have their own diffff
* girlpowers are reordered by topic now and comes with many new examples
* send/receive nodes now show their channel name by default (can be switched off via middleclick)
* improved startup time by reducing the amount dynamic plugin re-builds
* fix for ((forum:double-bang?full=1)) double bang issue. 

!!code editor
* added async/await to code editor syntax highlighting
* fixed ((forum:pluging-code-editor-flashing))

!!patch editor 
* now supporting basic touch gestures:
**Two finger pan = Canvas pan
**Press and Tab = Middle Mouse Click
**Two Finger Tab = Right Mouse Click (not shown in this video)
**Long Press = Right Mouse Click
**Long Press + Drag = Right Drag
* new selection behavior:
** if nodes and links are in a selection only nodes are selected
** if only links are in a selection they are selected
** pressing ctrl selects both links and nodes (old default)
** pressing shift only selects links
* IOBox labels now above node if iobox is inlet

!!boygrouping
* the TCP server will now use an in- and outbound queue per peer client to receive and send messages. fixes boygroup server freeze when one of the clients is frozen
* TCP server will close connection to peer client if outbound queue is full
* TCP client will also use an outbound queue now - shouldn't freeze anymore if server freezes or connection down
* fixed possible deadlock if client loses connection
* fixed issue that caused a boygroup client to not startup
* fixed access violation in nodes connected to a bridge and having nil on one of its inputs

!!changed nodes
* basic overhaul to keyboard and mouse nodes - see ((blog:keyboard-mouse-and-touch-news))
* improved performance of ((node:Cons (Spreads)))
* improved performance of ((node:Select (Value)))
* ((node:Typewriter (String))) is now spreadable
* ((node:Writer (Raw))) will only evaluate upstream pins if ((pin:Do Write)) is set to true

* receive nodes now will turn red on connection errors
* IOBox (Node) can now display raw byte sequences
* Renderer (EX9) ((pin:Clip Device)) now off by default (as this caused problems with nvidia cards)

!!fixed nodes
* fixed stack overflow in ((node:Queue (Raw)))
* HID nodes should work properly now in x64
* Dir (File) used to AV if input is empty
* Memory (Debug) can now log to tty even without a renderer attached
* ModificationDate node no longer AVs if input file not available
* SpellValue now works with Unicode
* Leap (Devices) now also requests data if vvvv is in background

* ((pin: Value)) of ((node:Element (XElement Split))) now only outputs the XElements' own text value (not a concatenated string of all its child text nodes as before). legacy ((pin: Value)) now available as ((pin: Deep Value))
* fixed problem with IOBox (String) when canceling a dir-open operation on it
* SharedMem (Windows) has no memory limit anymore
* Normals (EX9.Geometry) no longer fails in x64
* replaced Copier (File Async) with legacy version and reimplemented as plugin - see ((forum:copier-(file-async)-does-not-copy-files-with-less-than-1024-bytes))
* fixed spread max calculation of Select nodes - bug came up when using with higher dimensional spreads
* fixed IOBox (Node) not evaluating upstream RAW nodes

!!plugin interfaces
* now available as nuget packages. see ((blog:nuget-development-packages))
* added ability to share the bin size pin in ISpread<ISpread<T>>. for an example look at the mouse join/split nodes [https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk/blob/develop/vvvv45/src/nodes/plugins/System/MouseNodes.cs|here]
* moved Plugin property from IInteralPluginHost to IPluginHost2 in order to access it from the host without the need to reference hosting

* new class DynamicStreamWriter - useful when length of underlying output stream is not known in advance
* fixed exception in BufferedStreamWriter when using with T other than a primitive data type
* fixed IDiffSpread<MouseState>.IsChanged and IDiffSpread<KeyboardState>.IsChanged properties - see ((forum:mouse.ischanged-always-true))
* added OutputRequiresInputEvaluation and IPluginHost.Evaluate methods in order to properly implement a generic frame delay node
