!!new
* Info (System ComPorts): retrieves installed ComPorts
* RoundRect (EX9.Geometry 2d) : Round rectangle mesh with inner/outer radius options.
* Decompose (Transform) : returns translate/scale and rotation (as quaternion).
* GetContactDetails (Box2d Spreaded) : Same as GetContactDetails (Box2d), but bodies/shapes ids/instances as per spread of two).
* HasContact (Box2d) : To check if two specific shapes/bodies are in contact.
* CreateBody (Box2d Persist) : Bodies created trough this node are persisted in the output pin, to avoid use of GetBodyById,GetBodyByCustom. 
* Camera (EX9.Geometry Collada): Returns view and projection matrix of selected cameras.
* DeCons (Spreads) : splits a spread along binsizes (reverse function to ((node:Cons (Spreads))) )
* DeCons (String) : -"-
* DeCons (Color) : -"-
* DeCons (Enumerations) : -"-
* DeCons (Transform) : -"-
* Store (Spreads) : (aka EditSpread or BuildSpread) stores a spread and sets/removes/insert slices w/o loop
* Store (String) : -"-
* Store (Color) : -"-
* Store (Enumerations) : -"-
* Store (Transform) : -"-

!!changed 
* SendEmail (Network): Now has a "Enable SSL" option / Encoding Option / Attachment posibility /can enable html in message body / full spreadable / sends email async (no vvvv freeze).
* Occurrence nodes got a bin size
* Combine (File Path): now known as MakePath (String) tries to make a (absolute) senseful Path out of any input
* Stack (Color/Value/String): now has a Default/Reset pin, to set to an initial state (with bin size). Also has a config pin to allow the full stack content as output.
* Segment (EX9.Geometry) : now has a phase pin


!!fixed
* Flash (EX9) : Mousecoordinates are transformed correctly now with transformations with rotation
* Select (String Advanced) : select pin bug fixed
* Select (Color Advanced) :  select pin bug fixed
* Select (Enumerations) :  select pin bug fixed
* Select (Transform) :  select pin bug fixed
* ChannelData (Bass) : Was not outputting full buffer
* Switch (Transform Advanced) : Was outputting nil if one transform in was nil, regardless if it was used at all. Now only output nil if one nil pin is used.
* Box2d : Bodies, Joints and Shapes now got a LiteTime Pin, to indicate how long they been created. 
* UpdateShape (Box2d) : Fixed but when shape was not refiltered then group index changes.
* Segment (EX9.Geometry 2d): Added a phase pin, also resolution now defaults to 20.
* Box2d : You can now set TTL (Time to live) in bodies. Allows you to set a delay before destruction.
* RS232 (Devices Spreadable): didn't evaluate if outputs not connected.
* Mesh (EX9.Geometry Collada): didn't call MarkPinChanged on mesh output pin leading to various problems in downstream nodes.
* + (Value Spectral Advanced), * (Value Spectral Advanced), Bounds (Spectral Advanced): expected behavior on nil input
* HitTests (all) : now rechecks for hit properly if object properties have changed.
