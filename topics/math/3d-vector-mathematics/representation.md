#  Representation
a vector **v** can be interpreted as:  

direction (x, y, z) and length |**v**|, arrow, a translation, connection between two points (see Subtrcation), as point (if the vector is a bounded vector to the origin), force, speed, velocity ....  

as symbol:   
letters, often bold or underlined **v**, **v**  

as three numbers (x, y, z):  
the vvvvector space is build up by combination of three orthogonal 1-dimensional directions, the x-, y- and z-axis. every direction that is not parallel to the axes could be described as a linear combination of three directions (vectors) that are parallel to the axes. a linear combination here is adding three vectors (see Addition). to include the second aspect of a vector (the length) the three (axis) vectors **n1**, **n2**, **n3** are set to length one, this is a orthonormal base. to build all other vectors with this base, the three base vectors length gets scaled with the numbers x, y, z and then the vectors are added together:  

**v** = x***n1** + y***n2** + z***n3** =  

because the **n** vectors are (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1) the result is:  

**v** = ( 1*x, 0*x, 0*x ) + ( 0*y, 1*y, 0*y ) + ( 0*z, 0*z, 1*z ) =  

= ( x, 0, 0 ) + ( 0, y, 0 ) + ( 0, 0, z ) = (x, y, z)
