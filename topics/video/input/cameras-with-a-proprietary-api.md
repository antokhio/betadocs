Professional cameras can typically be accessed via a propietary API. Those can be implemented in a [plugin](xref:766d8ac2-5145-417d-b2df-37d24e3b2b6f) like it was done for the <span class="node">uEyeCam (Devices)</span>.  

The <a href="https://vvvv.org/contribution/vvvv.packs.image" class="extURL contribution" target="_blank">Image Pack</a> provides support for some more cameras (including Canon EOS, Point Grey, PlayStation Eye).
