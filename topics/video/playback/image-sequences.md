The <span class="node">Player (EX9.Texture)</span> accesses individual frames stored in a directory by frameindices. It has been optimized for high bandwidth texture throughput. Textures are kept in RAM and are only transferred to the GPU as needed.  

It accepts a variety of formats, also some that are not supported by <span class="node">FileTexture (EX9.Texture)</span> such as TIFFs.  

Several sequences (stored in different folders) can be played in parallel.
