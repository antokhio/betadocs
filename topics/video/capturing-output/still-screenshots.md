# Still Screenshots




<kbd>Ctrl+1</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+2</kbd>  
Screenshot of the active vvvv-window with / without the window border.  

<kbd>Shift+Ctrl+1</kbd> / <kbd>Shift+Ctrl+2 </kbd> 
The same as above, but the file-save dialog is invoked.  

<kbd>Ctrl+3</kbd>  
Make a screenshot name it and post directly to the "Screenshots of the Days" on vvvv.org (as seen on the front page).  

* If you shoot a patch, the file is placed in the patchs directory. Press <kbd>ALT+E</kbd> to open an explorer window to this path.   
* If you shoot any other vvvv-window the file is placed in the directory in which its parent patch is placed in (e.g. shoot a renderer and search the image in the directory of the patch in which the Renderer node is placed in).  
* If a patch is not yet saved (shows something like 0.v4p//// in its windowtitle) you'll find the the .png in vvvvs root directory.  
* Pressing one of the shortcuts also copies the image to the clipboard which allows you to paste <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> it into other programs like Photoshop, Word etc.
