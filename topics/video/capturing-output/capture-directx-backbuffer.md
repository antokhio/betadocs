# Capture DirectX Backbuffer


#### Special tools:
<a href="http://www.fraps.com/" class="extURL" target="_blank">Fraps</a>  
<a href="http://www.exkode.com/home-en.html" class="extURL" target="_blank">Dxtory</a>  
<a href="http://obsproject.com/" class="extURL" target="_blank">Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)</a>  



These tools directly capture the backbuffer of any directx application. On their website they claim to record at high framerates and high resolution directly to .avi files.  

There's also the promising nvidia shadowplay software (no vvvv support yet).
