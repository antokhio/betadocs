The simplest way to talk to any Microcontroller Board from vvvv is by using the ((node:FirmataBoard (Devices))) node via the Firmata protocol. Check the dedicated ((firmata-protocol|Firmata page)) on how to use it.

A bit more advanced and direct way to talk to a microcontroller is by using the ((node:RS232 (Devices))).

Motors are coming in three flavours:
* DC Motors: the most simple ones: give it voltage, it will start to spin
* Stepper Motors: more precise ones, in most cases an external hardware driver is required in order to control them easily
* Servo Motors: a complex things from inside, they know their position. Can be controlled via simple PWM signal

Usually a motor (or its driver) is controlled by a microcontroller (eg. Arduino).

* the latest WiiMote with builtin MotionPlus, ''code'' is LMB-RVL-WR/Z-C4 (and C6) does not connect with vvvv, with GlovePIE you get partial data, connectivity is buggy, it has a reset button on the plastic battery cover so that it can be reset without removing the cover.
