From now on you can easily design your very complex logical state machine for the ((node:Automata (Animation))) node with a graphical editor called [http://qfsm.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html|Qfsm]. Stefan Duffner, the developer of Qfsm, kindly added an export window for vvvv automata code:

{img src = "automataexport_1.png" }

Download Qfsm for windows here:

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/qfsm/]

To use it, simply create a new state machine with the following settings:

{img src = "qsfm_settings.png" }

Then make some states an connect them with events (transitions). these transitions will be the input pins for the automata node. If you want a special output bang for a transition, enter a name in the 'output' field of the transition. if this field is empty a default output will be created named after the state to which it goes with the prefix 'Do'. enable in menu view->mealey outputs to see the outputs at the transitions as well.
