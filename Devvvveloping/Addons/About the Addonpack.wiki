((About Addons|Addons)) are shipping as a separate download in the form of addonpacks. They include the following types of contents:

 \effects

 \freeframe

 \modules
 
 \plugins

There is at least one addonpack per vvvv release, possibly more, providing consistent collections of addons for specific releases. By naming the packages like:
 addonpack_betaXX_01.zip
it will always be obvious which vvvv-release a specific pack is supposed to work with.

~~~

Simply unzip the addonpack to your \vvvv_45betaXX directory overwriting all files, if you are asked. 

^note:
Only use addonpacks with vvvv-releases that carry the same version number (ie. betaXX).
^ 

There can be several addonpacks for one vvvv-release, numbered like addonpack_betaXX_01, ..._betaXX_02, ..._betaXX_NN. 
__Always use the latest available.__
