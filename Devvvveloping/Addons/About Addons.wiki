vvvv itself is not open source, but it offers different open interfaces for people to write their own nodes:

;((Plugins)):most general interface for writing multipurpose nodes 
;((Freeframes)):video effects/analysis nodes
;((Effects)):vertex- and pixelshader
;((Modules)):reusable vvvv-patches
;((VST)):audio effects/analysis nodes

Many users share their work mostly under the [http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html|LGPL] opensource license. Those nodes, not being part of the main executable are called ''addons'' and their sources are being hosted on [https://github.com/vvvv/vvvv-sdk|github]

All contributed addons are available via a separately downloadable ((About the Addonpack|addonpack)) in order to allow independent release cycles of the main vvvv application and user submitted content.
