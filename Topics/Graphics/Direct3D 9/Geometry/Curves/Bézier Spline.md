*Quadratic Bézier Curve with its Control Point*

*Cubic Bézier Curve with its two Control Points*  



The most popular Bézier curves are quadratic and cubic in nature as higher degree curves are expensive to draw, evaluate and not so intuitive to handle.   

**Characteristics**  
* they cannot exactly describe circles and ellipses  
* they are a special cases of B-Spline
