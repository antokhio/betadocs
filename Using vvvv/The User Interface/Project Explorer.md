# Project Explorer

![](~/img/TheGui-ProjectExplorer2.png "")   

Press **CTRL+J** to bring up the ProjectExplorer window. Here you see a treeview of all your projects and this is where you can add/remove  
* documents  
* references   
to/from projects.  

#### Documents
While you can define multiple plugin-classes within a document (just put them one after the other) with a bigger set of nodes it may be a good idea to split them into multiple documents. Just right-click your project in the explorer and select *Add..* to add an existing or new document.   

#### References
Here you you will usually either:  
* reference libraries from the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yf1d93sz%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" class="extURL" target="_blank">GAC</a>  
* or reference a thirdparty managed library (eg. a device driver)
