* you can now find the nodelist.xml file in \bin which holds a specification of all nodes in the current release (still missing: plugins, modules, freeframes, effects)
* new commandline argument: "/shutup" will disable all shortcuts (but Alt-F4) and won't let patches nor inspectors show up
* vvvv now supports VST effects and instruments within sound graphs
