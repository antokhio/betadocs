!!general
* enabled SSH, Facebook, ArduinoFirmata, RS232 and ShellExecute nodes in 64 bit build
!!new nodes
* AsXElement (JSON) as pendant to AsXElement (XML)
!!changed nodes
* updated bindings of ((node:HTMLTexture (Ex9.Texture))) to latest released CEF 1.1364.1123 (see [http://code.google.com/p/chromiumembedded/|official website] for a complete list of changes)
* ((node:FirmataEncode))/((node:FirmataDecode)) support Capability reports (request and show) that show your boards available pins and their respective modes + resolution
* ((node:Arduino (StandardFirmata 2.x))) reflects changes of above + uses updated ((node:RS232)) which offers a way to bypass the autorest on most arduino boards.
* TobiiEyetracker nodes (Browser, Headbox, XConfig, Tracking, Eyetracker, Calibration). For using Tobii eyetracking devices.
!!fixed nodes
* ((node:HTMLTexture (Ex9.Texture)))
** crashed when doing fast url switching (see ((/forum-alpha/html-texture-performance|here))): fixed by blocking until internal used CEF browser object (used by each slice of a renderer) is created.
** crashed when decreasing the width/height inputs (see ((forum:htmltexture-bugs-driving-me-crazy|here))): fixed by doing an intersect for each dirty rectangle reported by cef before writing to the texture.
** crashed when setting new "Update DOM" pin to true: should be fixed by new blocking behaviour in constructor.
** fixed various issues in CefXmlReader (used to translate CefDom to XDocument/XElement).
* MIDI module fixes
** normalised MidiNoteOut, MidiControllerOut, MidiProgramOut to consistently use channels 0-15 on pins. 
** fixed incorrect channel mappings. 
** resetting the channel pin does not result in setting a value of 0.5.
