!! new nodes

* PolygonEditor (2d): create Polygons and edit them via Mouse and Keyboard interaction. Used in and initially developed for  ((contribution:badmapper)).

!! changed nodes
* Camera (Transform Orbit) now has "reset state" - controlled by input pins until any of its hotkeys are pressed, analogous to Camera (Transform Softimage)
* Updated HTMLTexture node to use CEF 3.1750.1738 - see ((blog:htmltexture-node-using-cef-3-now))
** The node is now finally available in 64 bit.
** The node will spawn processes in background (like chrome does) which do the rendering, javascript etc.
** CEF can be configured through command line arguments to vvvv.exe - a general overview can be found here: http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/ - not all working though
** Changed default value of BaseUrl pin:
*** New default is empty string in which case the node will use the local patch path as base URL.
*** The node will also append a trailing slash to base URLs using the file:// scheme as described here: ((/forum-alpha/64bit-htmltexture%28string%29-relative-local-paths-command-lines))
** The node is able to automatically set the size of its texture if width or height is set to zero.
** The node will hold on to previously computed values and the IsLoading output will stay true as long as
*** CEF reports that it is loading content
*** DOM was not retrieved yet
*** Auto-size is enabled and document size wasn't retrieved yet
*** A texture is in a dirty state

!! fixed nodes
* Twirl (EX9.Texture Filter) was mistakenly spreaded inside, causing slowdown; fixed now
* Mesh (EX9.Geometry Join Subset) now handles 32bit indexbuffers
* HTMLTexture (EX9.Texture)
** ((forum:htmltexture-bug-(possibly-some-event-wrongly-handled))) not crashing anymore.
** Fixed DOM issues with XML namespaces.
