!!Fixed Nodes
* Advanced Sequencer has new option to keep buffer position once we stop recording.
* TodoMap current variable can be selected from main node (so learning can also be done through patch).
* TodoMap gui updates when we switch learn mode.
* SphericalSpreads spreaded had varying inital positions ((forum:sphericalspread-bug-with-spreaded-spreadcount|read>))
* Reader (File Advanced) index was not working when reading characterwise ((forum:reader-(advanced)-problem|read>))
* Map (Value Interval Advanced) bin size was inconsisten over pins and 0 caused freeze
* TimerFlop Reset pin now spreadable ((forum:timerflop-reset-pin-not-spreadable-at-the-moment|read>))
* Bounds (Spectral Vector) was misbehaving on binsize 0 ((forum:bounds-(spectral-advanced)|read>))
* lots of fixes on various TextureFX modules

!!Changed Nodes
* TimerFlop: Time defaults to 1, new output Running indicating percentage until it switches the output to 1
* Text EX9.Texture: adapted to new interface, should be faster when spreaded
* DeCons now deprecated and (automatically) replaced by native Unzip node (Bin Versions)
* Vector Size nodes( ... (... Advanced)) completely rewritten:
** changed Version postfix from Advanced to Vector
** Vector pin not hidden anylonger
** using IStream interface: a little slower on static input with low slice count, but much faster on higher slicecounts and changing input than before
** helper class is generic - resulted in some new nodes in other categories along the way

!!New Nodes
* TodoMap has node to delete a mapping on selected variable.
* TodoMap node to retrieve mapping info on selected variable.
* Typewriter (String)
* CAR (... Bin)
* CDR (... Bin)
* Reverse (... Bin)
* Shift (... Bin)
* Mean, MeanSquare, RootMeanSquare, GeometricMean & HarmonicMean in Vector Versions

*Bump, BlurRadial3D, Growth, Preview, RenderTargetFisheye, TransformTexture (details in helppatches)
*CrossToCube, CubeToCross, CubeToPano and PanoToCube - modules for converting cubemap textures (check their helppatches to see why you need cubemaps)
* many new TextureFX modules added by ((user:lecloneur))
