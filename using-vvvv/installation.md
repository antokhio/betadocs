## Installing

### Installer

* Running the installer prompts you with "User Account Control" confirming its authenticity  
* Simply click through the installer  
* By default vvvv will be installed into **C:\vvvv**, because it won't work in **C:\Program Files**...  
* The Installer optionally installs the addonpack.

[Best practices with Bootcamp](xref:be87c353-6012-4044-8a1e-5ed0afb1c799).  


### Offline Installer

* Simply click through the offline Installer  
* The addonpack won't be installed by default  
* If you choose to install the addopack, the installer will download and install it for you. Otherwise you can download the addopack manually and extract it into your vvvv-folder so that the \addonpack directory is placed right next to the \girlpower directory.  



## Start vvvv
