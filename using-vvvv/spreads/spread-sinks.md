# Spread Sinks


There are a couple of nodes that apply an operation between the slices of a spread.   
They are also referred to as "spectral operations". Below is a listing of the most popular.  


More such operations are available and can be found by querying the [Node Browser](xref:eeb8526d-0085-4219-a138-32ac397853f1) for the term "spectral".
