# Window Modes

![](~/img/BasicPatching_WindowModes_0.png "")   


Each window in vvvv also has a node associated. In other words: some nodes in vvvv have an associated window. You can identify those nodes by their [icons](xref:10b82e0c-720a-48e1-91e4-d8c65d2c3be1#node).   

Nodes with windows can be displayed in four modes:  
* Hidden: only the node is visible  
* InABox: node as box, containing the window  
* Windowed: node with separate window  
* Fullscreen: window visible fullscreen  

Use the following shortcuts to switch to the respective modes:  
* Hidden <kbd>Alt+3</kbd>
* InABox <kbd>Alt+2</kbd>
* Windowed <kbd>Alt+1</kbd>
* Full Screen <kbd>Alt+Enter</kbd>

As an alternative quick shortcut to toggle between the *hidden* and *windowed* modes simply rightclick a node.  

>note:  
There is a difference between hiding and closing a patch (or any window) in vvvv:  
* if you **hide** a window <kbd>ALT+3</kbd>, its associated node will still be part of the system and continue working  
* if you **close** a window <kbd>CTRL+W</kbd>, its associated node will be removed from its patch and thus no longer be part of the program
