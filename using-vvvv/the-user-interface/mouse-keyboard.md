# Mouse & Keyboard

The user interface of vvvv has been designed to be used with a three-button mouse. If you don't have a middle mousebutton in vvvv you can always simulate a middle-click using <span class="keyseq"><kbd>SPACE</kbd></span>+rightclick.  

Also vvvv's ease of use heavily relies on shortcuts. Here is how you can learn about them:
