# Docking

![](~/img/BasicPatching_Docking.png "")   



When working with multiple windows, docking can be useful to stack windows on top of each other to save precious screenspace.   

#### Dock
Dock one window to another by pressing <span class="keyseq"><kbd>ALT</kbd></span> while clicking inside it. Then drag it onto another window and release the mouse button when a gray border appears inside the target window.   
Dock a stack of docked windows onto another window by doing the same while pressing <span class="keyseq"><kbd>ALT</kbd><kbd>SHIFT</kbd></span>.  

#### Undock
Undock windows by pressing <span class="keyseq"><kbd>ALT</kbd></span> while leftclicking inside of it.   

#### Tabs 
Use the tabs to navigate between the different patches. Rightclick a tab to find the patchs node in its parentpatch.
