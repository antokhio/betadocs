!!Further on our agenda, to be reviewed after the vvvv gamma release:
(without claim of completeness and in no particular order)
* Node Libraries
** 3d/VR/AR graphics and physics simulations using VL.Xenko
** Audio/Video playback using VL.GStreamer
** UI library
** Logging library
** 2d physics library
** Machine learning and AI
** More libraries (devices,..)
* Deployment: OSX/Linux executables, mobile (iOS/Android), when available investigate deployment to Meadow and ultimately why not to the web.
* Run editor on osx/linux
* Improve Navigation (Browserlike, live object graph, multi-window support)
* Integrating additional editors (Node Inspektor, Timelines, State machines, Curves, Meshes, ..)
* AssetManager
* Package management (create, deploy, consume packages)
* Version control system support
* Higherlevel language features
* Better debugging support
* Visual diff/merge
* VL integration in other tools
